## Overview

> **THE RISC-V PRIVATE PROVING RUNTIME**

**SOLANACHAN.RS** is a **privacy runtime** for executing **RISC-V programs** under **verifiable confidentiality**.  
It uses **zkSNARK-based proof generation** to prove correct execution of programs without exposing inputs, state, or outputs.  

Inspired by **Monero** and **Zcash**, it extends privacy from *payments* to *computation*, enabling developers to build systems that are both **trustless** and **confidential**.

## Problem / Solution

### The Problem

Existing privacy technologies like **Monero** and **Zcash** protect *transactions*, not *computation*.  
They ensure confidential payments and balances, but they don’t support private logic, state transitions, or data processing.  

Developers today face hard limitations:
- Application logic and user data are fully visible during execution.  
- Privacy systems are domain-specific (e.g., shielded transactions) and non-generalizable.  
- Building verifiable private computation still requires deep cryptographic expertise.  

There is no open, general-purpose framework for **private, verifiable computation**.

### The Solution

**MONEROCHAN.RS** introduces a **RISC-V privacy runtime** that combines:
- **Deterministic program execution**, ensuring verifiable reproducibility.  
- **zkSNARK-based proofs**, guaranteeing correctness without revealing data.  
- **Optimized cryptographic precompiles**, enabling real-world performance for privacy workloads.  

This architecture allows developers to build applications such as:
- **Private data collaboration** — compute on encrypted data without disclosure.  
- **Private AI inference** — run models on confidential inputs verifiably.  
- **Private DeFi** — enable on-chain logic without revealing user state.  
- **Confidential rollups and bridges** — bridge ecosystems with strong privacy guarantees.  

MONEROCHAN.RS extends privacy from **value** to **computation**, forming the foundation for a new class of decentralized, private applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the CLI**:
   ```sh
   cargo install monerochan-cli
   ```

2. **Create an example project**:
   ```sh
   cargo monerochan new my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

3. **Read the project README** for detailed instructions:
   ```sh
   cat README.md
   ```

The project template includes a complete example with instructions for executing programs and generating proofs.
